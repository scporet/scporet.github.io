    <h1> About Us </h1>

<p><img id="stamp" src="/assets/images/almostnomads.png" alt="Your Hosts" /> Hello, and welcome! So, what's with creating a travel blog?  First, it's a place for family and friends to drop by and read about our favorite experiences and past travels (yawn! .. and also, boring!).  </p>

<p>Ok, so maybe it's not that boring.... but since I don't subscribe to one of the bloated social media sites this is the next-best alternative,  In addition:</p>

<ol>
  <li>This was a good way to update some of my tech skills</li>
  <li>I needed a place to drop some of the hundreds of photos I have in my archive, and</li>
  <li>Get in the practice of writing again (next to talking, my favotite method of communication)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-you-wont-see-in-this-blog">What you wonâ€™t see in this Blog</h2>

<p>One thing about owning all the content on your own web log space - NO ADVERTISING!  WhooHoo!  Yes, no ugly ads that sneak up under you finger while reading posts (I hate those!).  Also, no tracking, persistent cookies, consent forms, etc.  Just good ole boring travel stories.</p>

<p>So if you navigated to this site, it was by invitation only.  Or, if you *Google* nomad or nomads, you may find this site buried under 1000-or-so other search results.  I don't participate in running analytics  against this blog, or have metadata buried in the pages to push to the top of a web search either.  Did I mention that there are boring travel stories here? </p>

<h2 id="why-nomads">Why Nomads?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="nomad-noun-n-member-of-a-people-or-tribe-who-move-from-place-to-place-to-find-pasture-and-food-or-a-person-who-continually-moves-from-place-to-place-wanderer">NOMAD. Noun <em>(n)</em>. Member of a people or tribe who move from place to place to find pasture and food; or, a person who continually moves from place to place; wanderer.</h4>
</blockquote>

<p>Moving every 2 to 3 years used to be my lifestyle.  Over the span of my military career, and the years that followed, I moved over 15 times; the last time about 3 years ago.  I can't say it will be our last move, but there will be some new travel stories to tell from the new base camp.  The way I see it, 15 moves to places to hang the hat, plus a few more places traveled for job requirements, and vacation felt like an  extended episode of "Planes, Trains, and Automobiles."  Lots of planes, road trips, hotels, and schlepping suitcases--even long before luggage had wheels!</p>

<p>All-in-all, I visited over 20 countries, including multiple landmarks and cities across states here at home.  To help record the travels, I invested in a global push-pin map (seen below) to capture our travels.</p>
