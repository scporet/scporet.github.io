<h1>Autumn Express</h1>

<p>I always enjoyed train travel. Well, enjoyed recreational train travel; not the kind that required me to rise at 4-something AM to catch the 5:40 to Washington, DC for those few years on the Maryland commuter rail.  Prior to that, I did get to know Amtrak routes quite well during time working up in Albany, NY.  For that time, working away from home, I would I hit the parking lot on Friday afternoon after work, with the weekend bag already packed in the boot, and streak down the NY Thruway, NJ Turnpike, onto I95 in DE, to make it back home to MD for a short weekend trip; reversing that action on Sunday night. That routine didn't last long.  After a few weekends, I decided to leave the driving to Amtrak.</p>

<h3>Good Timing in Finding the Inaugural Fall Express</h3>

<p><img id="l_small" src="/assets/images/amtrak_1.jpg" alt="Amtrak Lunch Box" />Leaving the Albany-Rensselaer station was a breeze, and a welcome relief from the 5-hour, one-way drive back to MD.  Although, boarding the connection rail at New York Penn Station was another experience.  But, it worked out well.  And I even accumulated some reward points and keyed into early promotions by signing up and using the phone app.  Which is where I found early booking information for the <a href="https://media.amtrak.com/2013/08/amtrak-operates-special-autumn-express-train/" target="_blank" alt="Complimentary Amtrak Lunch"> Inaugural Fall Express trip.</a></p>

<p>This was a win-win for us.  First, we enjoy train travel.  Second, Fall is our favorite season.  So, to have the opportunity to take this inaugural trip during our favorite time of year was a real treat.  We boarded the trip from the Amtrak <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30th_Street_Station#In_popular_culture" target="_blank">30th Street Station in Philadelphia</a>-the same one showcased in the movie, Trading Places (one of my favorite movies!).</p>

<h3>Catch the trip on YouTube</h3>

<p>There are some real train enthusiasts out there.  And I found a group that captured the inaugural trip in several youtube videos.  Click on the picture frame below to view:</p>

<h3>Norfolk Southern Line Run</h3>

<p>something to talk about.  I guess we wouldn't pencil this travel excursion into the calendar each year. But, it was classify this as an annual must fun.  , cool. One of the benefits of frequent rail travel is accumulating rewards points.  Traveling round trip on the Amtrak Empire and Northeast Corridor lines for those few months allowed me to build up some rewwith taking the So, one of the think I learned traveling Amtrak was to join the rewards program and build points for those weekend runs down the Empire Line to Penn Station, NY where I hopped on a connection On the route down Route 340 from Maryland, we made an afternoon stop at Harpers Ferry, WV.  It's cool how Rt. 340 crosses from Maryland into Virginia, and takes a right turn into West Virginia.  It's better viewed from the Wikimedia map of

<h3>Lancaster County</h3>
The use of lighting in the cavern is the only piece of technology found in the underground tour.  A cell phone is useless (other than taking pictures). Which, in my honest opinion, allows one to appreciate the view.  There is quite a bit of information of the cavern website and others sources that I won't repeat here.  But I can say, it's a geological marvel to see.  There are tons of photos found online, but nothing matches the hour walking tour.
