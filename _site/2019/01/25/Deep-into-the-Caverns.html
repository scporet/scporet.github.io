<h1>Appalacian Trail Trip to Luray Caverns</h1>

<p>In my travels up and down the Interstate routes over the years, I must of passed cavern row on I81 a dozen times driving from the FL Gulf Coast to the Northeast to visit family.  I always remembered passing the sign for <a href="https://luraycaverns.com/" target="_blank">Luray Caverns</a>.  In my haste of praying to the church of blessed acceleration (love that Blues Brothers pun!), I'd never seem to find the time to make a stop there.  It wasn't until a few years later, living in the Chesapeake area, when we lived close enough to plan a long weekend journey.  </p>

<h3>Harpers Ferry</h3>

Our route took down Route 340, from Maryland to Luray, with a stop at Harpers Ferry.&lt;/p&gt;

<h3>Largest Cavern on the East Coast</h3>
<p><img id="l_small" src="/assets/images/cavern_11.jpg" alt="Cavern Location Marker" />Yes, that's not only a boast, but true.  In addition, the air quality in the cavern is unique; better than the clearest day of the year. No kidding. Our tour guide mentioned that allergy suffers feel instant relief when touring the cavern. Not surprised, since the The temperature inside the cavern is always 54 degrees-even no matter what the thermostat reads above ground.</p>

<p>The use of lighting in the cavern is the only piece of technology found in the underground tour.  A cell phone is useless (other than taking pictures). Which, in my honest opinion, allows one to appreciate the view.  There is quite a bit of information of the cavern website and others sources that I won't repeat here.  But I can say, it's a geological marvel to see.  There are tons of photos found online, but nothing matches the hour walking tour. </p>

<h3>Car and Carriage Museum</h3>

<p>There are a couple of additional attractions to see once the cavern tour is completed.  There's a car and carriage museum that has some nice early-model automobiles on display-both domestic and foreign models.  I think the earliest model the have is an 1897 Mercedes.  I liked the Stanley Steamer and early Cadillacs.  Some of my favorite are shown below.  I should also mention the early toy and train collection display there, too.  I didn't spend much time there since I spent most of the time admiring the cars.</p>

<h3>Hitting the Appalacian Trail</h3>
<p>One of my favorie places visited was Sachs Covered Bridge (originally, Sauchs).  This bridge was originally built in 1854, and restored in 1996.  It was crossed by both Union and Confederate troops during the Civil War.</p>
