         <p>During my time working in upstate New York I had the unique opportunity to visit the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/sara/index.htm" target="_blank">Saratoga National Park</a>.  Not only do I enjoy history (The <a href="https://history.com" target="_blank">History Channel</a> is on my cable favorites list!), I have read plenty books on the American Revolution, and usually tune into any Revolutionary War-era program on TV.  I have to say, this trip was not a disappointment, and remains top of the list of sites I would like to return with grandkids in-tow.</p>

<h3>Battleground Walking Tour</h3>

<p>There's ample parking at the Visitor Center, and view some of the artifacts and battlefield information was helpful.  Of course, don't venture out on the tour without grabbing a tour map of the park.  I decided to forego taking the car on the driving tour road and settled for walking the grounds.  I would highly recommend wearing comfortable shoes if you decide on doing the same.</p>

</p>

<p>For that time, working away from home, I would I hit the parking lot on Friday afternoon after work, with the weekend bag already packed in the boot, and streak down the NY Thruway, NJ Turnpike, onto I95 in DE, to make it back home to MD for a short weekend trip; reversing that action on Sunday night. That routine didn't last long.  After a few weekends, I decided to leave the driving to Amtrak.</p>

<h3>Saratoga Monument</h3>

<p><img id="l_small" src="/assets/images/hist8.jpg" alt="Amtrak Lunch Box" />In late September, British Army General Clinton was moving his army north to support Burgoyne, marching within 30 miles of Albany before General Howe order his return to New York City.  And that's what today's fighting force calls a poor strategic move.  As Burgoynes  was Leaving the Albany-Rensselaer station was a breeze, and a welcome relief from the 5-hour, one-way drive back to MD.  Although, boarding the connection rail at New York Penn Station was another experience.  But, it worked out well.  And I even accumulated some reward points and keyed into early promotions by signing up and using the phone app.  Which is where I found early booking information for the <a href="https://media.amtrak.com/2013/08/amtrak-operates-special-autumn-express-train/" target="_blank" alt="Complimentary Amtrak Lunch"> Inaugural Fall Express trip.</a></p>

<p>This was a win-win for us.  First, we enjoy train travel.  Second, Fall is our favorite season.  So, to have the opportunity to take this inaugural trip during our favorite time of year was a real treat.  We boarded the trip from the Amtrak <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30th_Street_Station#In_popular_culture" target="_blank">30th Street Station in Philadelphia</a>-the same one showcased in the movie, Trading Places (one of my favorite movies!).  All 16 cars were full, and included a cafe car (which was pretty packed the whole trip).  All passengers were provided a boxed lunch in a commemorative lunchbag. </p>

<h3>Catch the trip on YouTube</h3>

<p>There are some real train enthusiasts out there.  And I found a group that captured the inaugural trip in several youtube videos.  Click on the picture frame below to view:</p>

<h3>Norfolk Southern Line Run</h3>

<p>The unique attraction with this inaugural trip was the history behind the rail system we traveled up the Susquehanna River.  This line is referred to as the <i>Port Road Branch</i>, but was originally built as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_and_Port_Deposit_Railroad" target="_blank">Columbia and Port Deposit Railroad</a>, built in the mid-19th century. The interesting part of this inaugural trip revealed that the Port Road Branch has not had passenger rail service since 1978.  All-in-all it was close to a 3-hour trip.  The hard part was that there were no stops.  Even though they advertised a stop along the Pennsylvania Colombia Secondary line somewhere in Lancaster. Although the train slowed in a few spots for passengers to take some nice photos, the longest spent at the historical <a href="https://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-1B3" target="_blank">Rockville Bridge</a>. </p>

<p>I wasn't complaining-but I'm sure a few smokers were not happy with the change of plans.  Out of the 254 miles traveled, I captured quite a few pictures from the scenic-sized windows that were available on the coach cars.  I'm not sure what class of cars we were on, although I heard some train enthusiasts mention <i>Horizon</i>. </p>

<p>This, and other Amtrak history can be found at <a href="https://history.amtrak.com/blogs/blog/digging-into-the-archives-special-trains-memorabilia" target="_blank">Amtrak archives</a> special trains blog.  There is plenty of information of special rail events over the years.</p>

<h3>Other Rail Trips we Made</h3>

<p>Even travel to the Lancaster, PA area?  While there, I recommend a visit to the <a href="  
https://www.strasburgrailroad.com/" target="_blank">Strasburg Railroad</a>.  Check out the website and explore the tours section.  They host rail trips for just about any occasion.  For our tour we selected the evening Wine and Cheese trip.  The Strasburg Railroad runs a short trip out to Paradise, PA and back.  It's about a 50-minute trip and worth the experience.

<p>During our time in MD, we also visited the <a href="http://www.wwrr.com/" target="_blank">Wilmington and Western Railroad</a> and museum. It's a full operating railroad and offers great party packages.  We indulged in the the 2.5 hour trip up to Hockessin, DE which includes a 30-minute layover to walk around the town.  Just enough time to grab a bite or shop.  We were lucky enough to catch an art show at the fire house right near the train station and was able to knock off a couple of Christmas presents off the list. </p>

<p>
Last but not least, is the <a href="https://www.newhoperailroad.com/" target="_blank">New Hope Railroad</a>.  Here we enjoyed a dining excursion through Bucks County on the traditional New Hope Branch. After we finished dinner in the parlor car, we headed out to the open observation car for the remainder of the trip where we enjoyed the summer air and view of the Bucks County countryside.  It was about a one hour trip up to Lahaska, PA where we changed direction and returned back to New Hope.  </p>
