<img id="stamp" src="/assets/images/almostnomads.png" alt="Your Hosts" /> Hello, and welcome! I'm not going to write a long, drawn-out bio here.  Besides, if you ask my wife, she would agree that I would tend to run on with a long description of what this blog is about if given the time.  The good thing about creating this blog, is to provide a place for family and friends to see what we're up to - since I don't prescribe to one the the bloated social media sites.  Besides, you all know I'm a techie who likes to dabble in new technologies.  I think I found a great <a href="jekyllrb.com">product</a> to help me get a blog up and running, with minmal effort....for a guy who used to build dynamic web sites. <br>

<h2> Why Nomads?</h2>

> #### NOMAD. Noun *(n)*. Member of a people or tribe who move from place to place to find pasture and food; or, a person who continually moves from place to place; wanderer.

<p>Moving place to place used to be a lifestyle for me.  Over the span of my military career, and the years that followed, I moved over 15 times.  I figured over 15 moves to places to hang the hat, plus a few more places traveled for job requirements, and vacation.  It was sort of an extended episode of "Planes, Trains, and Automobiles."  Lots of planes, road trips, hotels, and shleping suitcaes--even long before luggage had wheels!</p>

<p>After all those years of moving we accumulated quite the inventory of pictures and memories.  I guess I could take advantage of some social app to post pictures and tag friends and family to view, but I'm not a big fan of social media sites.  So, "why put all that work into building a blog?" you may ask?  Well, there are some new static web site technologies out there that I would like to learn, and there's no better was to learn than through doing.  And this blog is a result.  Enjoy!</p>
