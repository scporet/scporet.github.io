<p><img id="stamp" src="/assets/images/almostnomads.png" alt="Your Hosts" /> Hello, and welcome! So, what's with creating a travel blog?  First, it's a place for family and friends to drop by and read about our favorite experiences and past travels (yawn! .. and also, boring!).  </p>

<p>Ok, so maybe it's not that boring.... but since I don't subscribe to one of the bloated social media sites this is the next-best alternative,  In addition:</p>

1. This was a good way to update some of my tech skills
2. I needed a place to drop some of the hundreds of photos I have in my archive, and
3. Get in the practice of writing again (next to talking, my favotite method of communication)  

## What you won't see in this Blog

<p>One thing about owning all the content on your own web log space - NO ADVERTISING!  WHooHoo!  Yes, no ugly ads that sneak up under you finger while reading posts just to I'm not going to write a long, drawn-out bio here.  Besides, if you ask my wife, she would agree that I would tend to run on with a long description of what this blog is about if given the time.    Besides, you all know I'm a techie who likes to dabble in new technologies.  I think I found a great <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">product</a> to help me get a blog up and running, with minmal effort....for a guy who used to build dynamic web sites. </p>

## Why Nomads?

> #### NOMAD. Noun *(n)*. Member of a people or tribe who move from place to place to find pasture and food; or, a person who continually moves from place to place; wanderer.

<p>Moving place to place used to be a lifestyle for me.  Over the span of my military career, and the years that followed, I moved over 15 times.  I figured over 15 moves to places to hang the hat, plus a few more places traveled for job requirements, and vacation.  It was sort of an extended episode of "Planes, Trains, and Automobiles."  Lots of planes, road trips, hotels, and schlepping suitcases--even long before luggage had wheels!</p>
