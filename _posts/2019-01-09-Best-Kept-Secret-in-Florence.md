<h1> Best Kept Secret in Florence</h1>

<p>Traveling through Tuscana was one of the most memorable moments of our Italy vacation.  Our tour guide (thanks, Franco!) suprised us with an unexpected stop at the <a href="https://www.abmc.gov/cemeteries-memorials/europe/florence-american-cemetery">Florence American Cemtery</a>.  It was a solumn visit.  The morning we left for San Giminano was cool, damp and foggy, which set the mood for the visit.</p>

The cemetery honors 4398 headstones, of troops that fought in the areaHere's an excerpt from the brochure I picked up during out visit:</p>

<blockquote>After the liberation of Rome on June 5, 1944, the U.S. Fifth Army and British Eighth Army, supported by the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces (MAAF), pushed northward toward the Gothic line.  That was a major German defense taking advantage of the Appennies that separated central Italy fro mthe Po Valley.
