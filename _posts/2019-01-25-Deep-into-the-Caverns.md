<h1>Trip to Luray Caverns and Surrounding Area</h1>

<p>In my travels up and down the Interstate routes over the years, I must of passed cavern row on I81 a dozen times driving from the FL Gulf Coast to the Northeast to visit family.  I always remembered passing the sign for Luray Caverns.  In my haste of praying to the church of blessed acceleration (love that Blues Brothers pun!), I'd never seem to find the time to make a stop there.  It wasn't until a few years later, living in the Chesapeake area, when we lived close enough to plan a long weekend journey.</p>

<p><img id="r_small" src="/assets/images/cavern_4.jpg" alt="Sauchs Bridge">One of my favorie places visited was Sachs Covered Bridge (originally, Sauchs).  This bridge was originally built in 1854, and restored in 1996.  It was crossed by both Union and Confederate troops during the Civil War.</p>

<p>I wasn't aware until our visit that this bridge is a frequent destination of ghost hunters, too.  My wife and I met a gentleman from West Virginia who was camped out there the night before with his ghost hunting troop. He confirmed that there is quite a bit of activity not only on the bridge, but in the fields Northeast of the bridge on the path toward the battlefield.</p>

<p>I'm an admirer of covered bridges, and this was one of the finest I've seen.  For good reason - it's restricted now to foot traffic only.  It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places and should be on the list of sights to see if ever visiting the area.  You can read more information about this bridge and others at the <a href="http://bridgehunter.com/pa/adams/sachs-covered/" target="_blank">Bridgehunter</a> website.</p>
