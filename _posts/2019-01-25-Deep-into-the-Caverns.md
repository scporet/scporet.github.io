<h1>Trip to Luray Caverns and Surrounding Area</h1>

<p>In my travels up and down the Interstate routes over the years, I must of passed cavern row on I81 a dozen times driving from the FL Gulf Coast to the Northeast to visit family.  I always remembered passing the sign for <a href="https://luraycaverns.com/" target="_blank">Luray Caverns</a>.  In my haste of praying to the church of blessed acceleration (love that Blues Brothers pun!), I'd never seem to find the time to make a stop there.  It wasn't until a few years later, living in the Chesapeake area, when we lived close enough to plan a long weekend journey.</p>

<h3>Largest Cavern on the East Coast</h3>
<p>Yes, that's not only a boast, but true.  In addition, the air quality in the cavern is unique; better than the clearest day of the year. No kidding. Our tour guide mentioned that allergy suffers feel instant relief when touring the cavern. Not surprised, since the The temperature inside the cavern </p>

<p>The use of lighting against the There is quite a bit of information of the website that I won't repeat here.  But I can say, it's a geological marvel to see, and a must to visit to appreciate. </p>

<p> I always liked traveling through the Appalacian trail tGetting to the site was a piece of cake.  </p>

<h3>Car and Carriage Museum</h3>

<p>There are a couple of additional attractions to see once the cavern tour is completed.  There's a car and carriage museum that has some nice early-model automobiles on display-both domestic and foreign models.  I think the earliest model the have is an 1897 Mercedes.  I liked the Stanley Steamer and early Cadillacs.  Some of my favorite are shown below.  I should also mention the early toy and train collection display there, too.  I didn't spend much time there since I spent most of the time admiring the cars.

<p><img id="r_small" src="/assets/images/cavern_4.jpg" alt="Sauchs Bridge">One of my favorie places visited was Sachs Covered Bridge (originally, Sauchs).  This bridge was originally built in 1854, and restored in 1996.  It was crossed by both Union and Confederate troops during the Civil War.</p>

<p>I wasn't aware until our visit that this bridge is a frequent destination of ghost hunters, too.  My wife and I met a gentleman from West Virginia who was camped out there the night before with his ghost hunting troop. He confirmed that there is quite a bit of activity not only on the bridge, but in the fields Northeast of the bridge on the path toward the battlefield.</p>

<p>I'm an admirer of covered bridges, and this was one of the finest I've seen.  For good reason - it's restricted now to foot traffic only.  It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places and should be on the list of sights to see if ever visiting the area.  You can read more information about this bridge and others at the <a href="http://bridgehunter.com/pa/adams/sachs-covered/" target="_blank">Bridgehunter</a> website.</p>
