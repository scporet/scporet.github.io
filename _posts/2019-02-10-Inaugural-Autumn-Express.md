<h1>Autumn Express</h1>

<p>I always enjoyed train travel. Well, enjoyed recreational train travel; not the kind that required me to rise at 4-something AM to catch the 5:40 to Washington, DC for those few years on the <a href="https://www.mta.maryland.gov/schedule/11079" target="_blank">Maryland commuter rail</a>-better known as MARC.  I did get to know the Amtrak routes quite well during a spell working up in Albany, NY.  For a while I would I hit the parking lot on Friday afternoon after work, with a weekend back already packed in the boot, and streak down the NY Thruway, NJ Turnpike, onto I95 in DE, to make it back home to MD for a short weekend trip-reversing that action on Sunday night. That routine didn't last long.  After 3 weekends of driving, I decided to leave the driving to Amtrak.</p>

<h3>Good Timing in Finding the Inaugural Fall Express</h3>

<p>Leaving the Albany-Rensselaer station was a breeze.  Although, boarding the connection rail at New York Penn Station was another experience.  But, it worked out well.  And I even accumulated some reward points and keyed into early promotions by signing up and using the phone app.  Which was key to getting an early booking on the <a href="https://media.amtrak.com/2013/08/amtrak-operates-special-autumn-express-train/" target="_blank"> Inaugural Fall Express trip.</a></p>

Traveling round trip on the Amtrak Empire and Northeast Corridor lines for those few months allowed me to build up some rewwith taking the So, one of the think I learned traveling Amtrak was to join the rewards program and build points for those weekend runs down the Empire Line to Penn Station, NY where I hopped on a connection On the route down Route 340 from Maryland, we made an afternoon stop at Harpers Ferry, WV.  It's cool how Rt. 340 crosses from Maryland into Virginia, and takes a right turn into West Virginia.  It's better viewed from the Wikimedia map of

<h3>The Inaugural Trip was Captured on YouTube</h3>

<img id="l_small" src="/assets/images/cavern_11.jpg" alt="Cavern Location Marker">Yes, that's not only a boast, but true.  In addition, the air quality in the cavern is unique; better than the clearest day of the year. No kidding. Our tour guide mentioned that allergy suffers feel instant relief when touring the cavern. Not surprised, since the The temperature inside the cavern is always 54 degrees-even no matter what the thermostat reads above ground.</p>

<p>The use of lighting in the cavern is the only piece of technology found in the underground tour.  A cell phone is useless (other than taking pictures). Which, in my honest opinion, allows one to appreciate the view.  There is quite a bit of information of the cavern website and others sources that I won't repeat here.  But I can say, it's a geological marvel to see.  There are tons of photos found online, but nothing matches the hour walking tour.

<h3>Car and Carriage Museum</h3>

<p>There are a couple of additional attractions to see once the cavern tour is completed.  There's a car and carriage museum that has some nice early-model automobiles on display-both domestic and foreign models.  I think the earliest model the have is an 1897 Mercedes.  I liked the Stanley Steamer and early Cadillacs.  Some of my favorite are shown below.  I should also mention the early toy and train collection display there, too.  I didn't spend much time there since I spent most of the time admiring the cars.

<h3>Hitting the Appalacian Trail</h3>
<p>During our trip back to the racnh, we entered Shenandoah National Park and hit the scenic Skyline Drive from the Luray entrace and headed north to exit at the Front Royal gate.  Other than some clouds, the weather was swell.  We were hoping for a little more color during the fall season, but it was still a nice drive.  There were tons of scenic lookout areas, including campsites and picnic areas.  I guess we should have planned better and pack a lunch; or even stop for some snacks before heading up the park trail.  Although, we were fortunate to hit the welcome center on our way out of the park, and stocked up on fluids and snacks before blazing a trail back to the homestead.</p>
