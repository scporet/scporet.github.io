<p id="top">Traveling through Tuscana was one of the most memorable moments of our Italy vacation.  Our tour guide (thanks, Franco!) suprised us with an unexpected stop at the <a href="https://www.abmc.gov/cemeteries-memorials/europe/florence-american-cemetery" target="_blank">Florence American Cemtery</a>.  It was a solumn visit.  The morning we left for San Giminano was cool, damp and foggy, which set the mood for the visit.</p>

<p>The cemetery spans 70 acres and honors the 6th South Arfrican Armored Division of the U.S. Fifth Army, who liberated this area on August 3, 1944.  The cemetery honors 4398 headstones, of troops that fought in the area. Here's an excerpt from the brochure I picked up during out visit:</p>

<blockquote>After the liberation of Rome on June 5, 1944, the U.S. Fifth Army and British Eighth Army, supported by the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces (MAAF), pushed northward toward the Gothic line.  That was a major German defense taking advantage of the Appennies that separated central Italy from the Po Valley.

<p><img id="l_small" src="/assets/images/IMG_0782.jpg" alt="Standing the Watch">This cemetery is one of many centeries and memorials managed by the <a href="https://www.abmc.gov" target="_blank">American Memorials and Battfield Commission</a> whose responsibility it is to operate and maintain American cemeteries in foreign countries.  </p>

<p>Since we were on a tight schedule, we were not afforded enough time to walk the entire gravesite.  I really wanted to hoof it up to the memorial building to view the atrium and the military operations map, along with wall engravings and lists of the missing; which can be viewed <a href="https://www.abmc.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Florence.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  We kept close to the entrance, but I was able to catch some nice photos of the view from the first plot and surrounding area.  The statue to the left is one of two 361st Regimental statues keeping watch over the gravesite.  It is located overlooking plot A (photo above).  There are 8 plots, symetrically aligned in formation of two-by-two, with a walking path up to the memorial building.  The visit was truly a welcome surprise for the tour group. </p>
