I"<p>During my time working in upstate New York I had the unique opportunity to visit the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/sara/index.htm" target="_blank">Saratoga National Park</a>.  Not only do I enjoy history (The <a href="https://history.com" target="_blank">History Channel</a> is on my cable favorites list!), I have read plenty books on the American Revolution, and usually tune into any Revolutionary War-era program on TV.  I have to say, this trip was not a disappointment, and remains top of the list of sites I would like to return with grandkids in-tow.</p>

<h3>Battleground Walking Tour</h3>

<p>There's ample parking at the Visitor Center, and view some of the artifacts and battlefield information was helpful.  Of course, don't venture out on the tour without grabbing a tour map of the park.  I decided to forego taking the car on the driving tour road and settled for walking the grounds.  I would highly recommend wearing comfortable shoes if you decide on doing the same.</p>

<p>There are about 10 important tour points that each have a posted summary of the significance of the location. </p>

And that's what today's fighting force calls a poor strategic move.  <a href="https://media.amtrak.com/2013/08/amtrak-operates-special-autumn-express-train/" target="_blank" alt="Complimentary Amtrak Lunch"> Inaugural Fall Express trip.</a></p>
