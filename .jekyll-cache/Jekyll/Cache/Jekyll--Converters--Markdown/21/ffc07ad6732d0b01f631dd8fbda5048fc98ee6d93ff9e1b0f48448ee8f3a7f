I"è<p>During my time working in upstate New York I had the unique opportunity to visit the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/sara/index.htm" target="_blank">Saratoga National Park</a>.  Not only do I enjoy history (The <a href="https://history.com" target="_blank">History Channel</a> is on my cable favorites list!), I have read plenty books on the American Revolution, and usually tune into any Revolutionary War-era program on TV.  I have to say, this trip was not a disappointment, and remains top of the list of sites I would like to return with grandkids in-tow.</p>

<h3>Battleground Walking Tour</h3>

<p>There's ample parking at the Visitor Center, and view some of the artifacts and battlefield information was helpful.  Of course, don't venture out on the tour without grabbing a tour map of the park.  I decided to forego taking the car on the driving tour road and settled for walking the grounds.  I would highly recommend wearing comfortable shoes if you decide on doing the same.</p>

<p>There are about 10 important tour points that each have a posted summary of the significance of the location. </p>

<h3>Bemus Heights</h3>

<p>The Battle of Saratoga has been classified into two battles.  The first, in September 1777 at Freemans Farm, where General Burgoyne clashed with a large Continental troop contingent and was forced to withdraw after failing to penetrate the American line. The second, and decisive Battle of Saratoga was held south of the Saratoga Battlefield, near the American encampment on October 7, 1777, where General Benedict Arnold led the American forces to inflict heavy loses to the British forces.  After withdrawing again from Bemus Heights, General Burgoyne's remaining force 5,000 troops were surrounded by 20,000 Continential soldiers, resulting in his surrender on October 17, 1777.</p>

<p><img id="l_small" src="/assets/images/hist8.jpg" alt="Amtrak Lunch Box" />In late September, British Army General Clinton was moving his army north to support Burgoyne, marching within 30 miles of Albany before General Howe order his return to New York City.  And that's what today's fighting force calls a poor strategic move.  <a href="https://media.amtrak.com/2013/08/amtrak-operates-special-autumn-express-train/" target="_blank" alt="Complimentary Amtrak Lunch"> Inaugural Fall Express trip.</a></p>
